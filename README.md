# leader-id

Need to install postgres and create leaderid database. To change user and password - change [this](https://github.com/tvorogme/leader-id/blob/d27501b48a3375059e32b539ac5d854d0de66eeb/db/models.py#L11) line.


Also, you may want to remove ```trash``` folder. It contains IPynbooks with experiments.
